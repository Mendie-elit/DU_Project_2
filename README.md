# DU_Project_2
DU data analytics boot camp project 2



The data used to create these visualizations was obtained from: Rosenfeld, Michael J., Reuben J. Thomas, and Sonia Hausen. 2019 How Couples Meet and Stay Together 2017 fresh sample.  [HCMST_2017_public_data_v1.1_stata]. Stanford, CA: Stanford University Libraries.


The data from HCMST_2017_public_data_v1.1 was converted to a csv file called `relationship_data_file.csv`.  For each data visualization created the `relationship_data_file.csv` was cleaned and loaded into a MySQL database under specific table names.
