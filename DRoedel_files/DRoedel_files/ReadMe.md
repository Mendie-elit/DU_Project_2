    For the Fresh Survey, the survey consisted of:
    general population adults, age 18+, English‐language survey‐takers residing in the United States, with an oversample of LGB adults; for the Recontact survey, the sample consisted of respondents from earlier waves of the How Couples Meet study. 
    The Fresh survey consisted of two stages: initial screening and the main survey with the study‐eligible respondents.
